# Marine Emissions Tools Beta 2

EPA's Marine Emissions Tools are designed to model emissions from Category 3 commercial marine vessels (CMV) given specific vessel information and operating conditions. This toolset  contains two R packages:
* [ShipEF](./ShipEF), which contains functions to assign marine vessel emission factors
* [ShipPowerModel](./ShipPowerModel), which contains functions to calculate ship propulsive power and auxiliary/boiler engine loads

See the individual package readme files for installation instructions. For information on how to use these packages, see the package documentation, vignettes, and the [cheat sheets](./CheatSheets).

## About this Beta Version
ShipEF and ShipPowerModel are currently in beta. A previous version of these R packages was used to develop the CMV inventories for the 2017 [National Emissions Inventoy](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/national-emissions-inventory-nei) (NEI). This beta version will form the basis for the CMV inventories for the 2020 NEI. Future versions of this toolset may include other features, such as capabilities for modeling Category 1 and 2 vessels.

Even though ShipEF and ShipPowerModel are currently in beta, these tools are consistent with the [EPA Port Emissions Inventory Guidance](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P10102U0.pdf), and therefore they may be used for voluntary and research purposes, as well as to develop inventories to meet regulatory requirements. For more information on how or why to develop a mobile source port-related air pollution emissions inventory, see the Port Emissions Inventory Guidance.
