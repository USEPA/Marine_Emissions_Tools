\title{Fuel Mix Table for auxiliary engines, by fuel type, engine type, and location.}
\format{
A data frame with 15 rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{Location}{Vessel location indicating fuel use patterns and fuel sulfur level per region. ECA indicates North American Emission Control Area}
\item{engineType}{Auxiliary engine type, "HSD"="High Speed Diesel","MSD"="Medium Speed Diesel","LNG"="Liquid Natural Gas"}
\item{fuelType}{Fuel type used by vessel: "RM/HFO"="Residual Marine/Heavy Fuel Oil","MGO/MDO"="Marine Gas Oil/Marine Diesel Oil","LNG="Liquid Natural Gas"}
\item{Proportion}{Indicates the proportion of vessels per engine type (from 0 to 1) which use each possible fuel within each region. Used to to calculate weighted average emission factors when vessel specific fuel information is not available. }
