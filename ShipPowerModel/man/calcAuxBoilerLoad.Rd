\usage{
calcAuxBoilerLoad(
  opMode,
  shipType,
  subType,
  method = "imo",
  output = "aux",
  inputTableLocation = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{opMode}{Operating mode (vector of strings) (see
\code{\link{calcOperatingMode}})}

\item{shipType}{Ship type (vector of strings) (see
\code{\link{calcShipType}})}

\item{subType}{Ship subtype (vector of strings) (see
\code{\link{calcSubType}})}

\item{method}{Select the methodology that should be used (i.e., which default
loads to use): \itemize{\item"imo"\item"starcrest"}}

\item{output}{Is this assignment for an auxiliary or boiler engine? Default
= "aux". Options: \itemize{
\item "aux"
\item "boiler"
}
Note: this argument is not used if \code{inputTableLocation} is used.}

\item{inputTableLocation}{File path (optional). Used to specify a user-supplied
set of auxiliary or boiler loads. If used, this is typically the same table
as the ship subtype table so that correct loads are assigned. See details for
formatting requirements.}
}
\value{
Auxiliary or boiler loads (kW) (vector of numericals)
}
\description{
Assigns auxiliary or boiler engine loads (kW) according to ship type, sub
type, and operating mode, based on the requested methodology.
}
\details{
This function has two sets of default auxiliary and boiler load assumptions
available for use: those consistent with IMO's subtypes or Starcrest's
subtypes. Since ship subtypes are used when assigning default auxiliary and
boiler engine load assumptions, the methodology selected here should match
with the methodology used for assigning ship subtypes. The IMO subtypes are
based on the Third GHG Study, and the Starcrest subtypes are based on the
2017 Port of Los Angeles Air Emissions Inventory.

If user-supplied auxiliary and/or boiler loads are available, or if custom
subtypes are used, these can be specified using the \code{inputTableLocation}
parameter. This file should be in .csv format with six columns and a header
row (additional columns are acceptable).
The headers should be: \itemize{
  \item "shipType"
  \item "subType"
  \item "Transit"
  \item "Maneuvering"
  \item "Berth"
  \item "Anchorage" }

The Transit, Maneuvering, Berth, and Anchorage columns should have values in
kW, and should contain either auxiliary *or* boiler loads. If user-supplied
loads are available for *both* auxiliary *and* boiler loads, these will need
to be saved in separate files, and this function will be called twice (once
with each file).

For more information about default auxiliary and boiler loads, see Section
3.6 and Appendix E of the Port Emissions Inventory Guidance.
