\usage{
calcSubType(
  shipType,
  DWT,
  GT,
  TEU,
  nPassengers = NULL,
  method = "imo",
  inputTableLocation = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shipType}{Ship type (vector of strings) (see \code{\link{calcShipType}})}

\item{DWT}{Deadweight tonnage (metric tons) (vector of numericals)}

\item{GT}{Gross tonnage (metric tons) (vector of numericals)}

\item{TEU}{Twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) (vector of numericals)}

\item{nPassengers}{Maximum number of passengers (vector of numericals. Note:
only applicable when using the Starcrest method)}

\item{method}{Select the methodology that should be used (i.e., which set of
subtypes to return): \itemize{
  \item "imo"
  \item "starcrest"
}
Note: this argument is not used if \code{inputTableLocation} is used.}

\item{inputTableLocation}{File path (optional). Used to specify a user-supplied
set of subtypes. If used, this is typically the same as the auxiliary and
boiler load table so that correct loads are assigned. See details for
formatting requirements.}

\value{
\code{subType} (vector of strings)
}
\description{
Assign ship subtype according to the vessel's ship type and
size, based on the requested methodology.
}
\details{
When passing ship size data in the \code{DWT}, \code{GT}, \code{TEU}, and
\code{nPassengers} parameters, use \code{NA} if the parameter is unknown or
not applicable (e.g., TEU doesn't apply for passenger vessels).

This function has two sets of ship subtypes available for use: IMO's subtypes
or Starcrest's subtypes. Since ship subtypes are important for assigning
default auxiliary and boiler engine assumptions, the methodology selected
here should match with the methodology used for assigning auxiliary and
boiler loads. The IMO subtypes are based on the Third GHG Study, and the
Starcrest subtypes are based on the 2017 Port of Los Angeles Air Emissions
Inventory.

If custom subtypes are desired, user-supplied subtypes could be specified
using the \code{inputTableLocation} parameter. This file should be in .csv
format with five columns and a header row (additional columns are acceptable).
The headers should be: \itemize{
  \item "shipType"
  \item "sizeMin"
  \item "sizeMax"
  \item "sizeUnits"
  \item "subType" }

Valid values for "sizeUnits" are: \itemize{
  \item "Deadweight"
  \item "TEU"
  \item "Gross_Tonnage"
  \item "Number_of_Passengers" }

\code{sizeMin} is inclusive and \code{sizeMax} is exclusive (i.e.,
\code{subType} is matched where \code{sizeMin} <= vessel size < \code{sizeMax}).

See \code{data(IMOGHG3_AuxLoadFactor)} or \code{data(Starcres2016_AuxLoadFactor)}
for an example of how this table can be structured.

For more information about ship subtypes, see Section 3.3.3 of the
Port Emissions Inventory Guidance.

Note: IMO GHG 3 uses vehicle carrier subtypes which are based on number of
vehicles. This information is frequently unavailable in vessel characteristics
datasets. However, the auxiliary loads are assumed to be the same for all
vehicle carriers regardless of size, so these number of vehicle subtypes are
replaced by those used in the C3RIA.

Note: IMO GHG 3 uses cubic meters (m^3) for liquified gas tankers. This
information is unavailable in vessel characteristics datasets, and it is
unclear which ship parameter value was used to determine these values.
Therefore, these vessel subtypes are defined by the same DWT bins as those
used for chemical tankers.
